I am a Research Software Engineer and Bioinformatics Scientist focusing on Immuno-Oncology. I work as a Clinical Bioinformatics Scientist at [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://github.com/Boehringer-Ingelheim/). Before that, I did my PhD at [icbi-lab](https://github.com/icbi-lab/). I am a core developer at [scverse](https://github.com/scverse/) maintaining [scirpy](https://github.com/scverse/scirpy) and some infrastructure packages. I am an active contributor to the [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core/) community. In my free time, I love being outdoors, in particular orienteering, mountain biking and ski mountaineering.

## Blog

Here are some articles I wrote:
 * 2024-12-30 | [Vergleich von dynamischem Stromtarif mit Fixpreistarif](https://grst.github.io/dynamischer-stromtarif/dynamischer-stromtarif.html) &ndash; Here I use electicity consumption data from our household to compare a hourly variable electricity tariff with a classical fixed-price tariff (in German). 
 * 2020-11-28 | [Low-level nextflow](https://grst.github.io/bioinformatics/2020/11/28/low-level-nextflow-hacking.html) &ndash; Here, I summarize some learnings on Groovy and Nextflow. 
 * 2020-07-16 | [Hallmarks of Good Scientific Software](https://grst.github.io/bioinformatics/2020/07/16/hallmarks-scientific-software.html) &ndash; In this post, I outline six key practices to enhance code quality and reproducibility in scientific research.
